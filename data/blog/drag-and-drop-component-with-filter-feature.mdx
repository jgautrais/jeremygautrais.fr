The HTML [Drag and Drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) API allows us to handle and customize drag-and-drop events in browsers. In this post, I will explain how I used this API to create a custom component, combined with a search filter.  
The final code and a demo is available at the following [Codepen](https://codepen.io/jgautrais/pen/MWvPaoy). In the article, I will explain how I customized a base template and implemented a filter feature to quickly search through available items to be dragged.

## Creating the component skeleton

To build this component, I used various resources to create a skeleton of the drag and drop component, in particular:

- [Using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API](https://web.dev/drag-and-drop/)
- [Creating a Parking Game With the HTML Drag and Drop API](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-parking-game-with-the-html-drag-and-drop-api/)

The objective of this component is to select various skills. Therefore we will be manipulating skill items in this example.
Using resources mentioned above, I ended up with the following component:

```html
<div class="container">
  <!-- Filter item -->
  <label for="search-input">Search skills:</label>
  <input type="text" value="" placeholder="skill" id="search-input" />

  <ul class="skills">
    <!-- Draggable items pool -->
    <li class="skills__item" draggable="true" id="0">
      Gardening
      <input type="hidden" name="skill[]" value="0" />

      <button type="button" class="remove-skill">X</button>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <form method="POST">
    <!-- Drop zone -->
    <ul class="drop-zone"></ul>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
  </form>
</div>
```

For readibility, I am omitting here Bootstrap specific class names. You can refer to the Codepen mentioned in the beginning to look at the detailed skeleton.
We have from top to bottom:

- filter component,
- skills pool (`<ul class="skills">`),
- drop zone (`<ul class="drop-zone">`)

The skills pool contains items which are made draggable. The drop zone is enclosed whithin a form so that the selected skills can be submitted and registered in database (we will not deal with this step here).  
To render a functional dragging sequence, I am using various events provided but the drag and drop API:

- for skills items:
  - dragstart,
  - dragend,
  - drop.
- for drop zone:
  - dragenter,
  - dragleave,
  - dragover,
  - drop.

I will not go into the details on how to listen to these events and how to implement their handlers as many resources, including those mentioned above, go through this process in great detail.
