In the past few weeks, I have changed the generation of my website from plain HTML, CSS + JavaScript to using a static site generator, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). My main reasons for choosing a static site generator (SSG) were the following:

- **Learning**: I wanted to learn how SSG works and to keep practicing a JS framework (React).
- **Scalability and maintainability**: My portfolio was starting to become a HTML labyrinth with never-ending web pages, which were more and more difficult to browse through. Using a framework make it easier to organize code and store site content.
- **Blogging**: I wanted to start a blog and have a more robust way of storing blog's data than putting it in HMTL raw content. With SSG, each blog post is stored in markup language, and pre-rendered into HTML at build time.
- **Performance**: Since pages are pre-rendered at build time, when a server request a file, the file is immediately returned without any processing. This heavily improves page loading time.
